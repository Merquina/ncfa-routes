# Session Summary (componentized app + parity with main)

Context
- Goal: Componentize the app with clean, reusable components and maintain functional parity with main.
- Added Storybook (for component/page visualization), but the app is source of truth.

Implemented (App)
- Routing + Pages
  - Hash router with routes: `/boxes`, `/dates`, `/workers`, `/route?rid=...`.
  - Route click navigates to dedicated details page (`route-details-page`) with back button.
- Components
  - Renamed/standardized: assignment-card → route-card (emits `route-selected`).
  - route-details component (materials, market/dropoff with map/phone, stops, print, full-route map).
  - route-list (filter, group-by; fixed grouping when filtering arrays).
  - worker-component (emoji cards) used on Workers page.
- Pages
  - By Date (`dates-page`): shows only next 7 upcoming routes from today (flat list).
  - By Worker (`workers-page`): separate emoji pickers for Workers and Volunteers; filtering applies and clears; restored grouped view on clear.
  - Boxes (`boxes-page`): removed header; sections scroll title to top on interaction; “Update & Share” uses Google sign‑in name.
- Header/UI
  - Hamburger positioned at bottom of green header; dropdown anchored below; title scales responsively and never wraps; reserved space so title does not collide with hamburger.
- Data + Auth
  - DataService returns normalized routes (id, date, sortDate, displayDate, type, workers, volunteers, vans, materials, stops).
  - Switched Sheets reads to OAuth (gapi client) only; removed API key code paths.
  - Token persistence + silent refresh; fetches user profile (name) and stores `gapi_user_name`.
- HMR
  - Added dev-only HMR hook to force full reload on component changes (avoids customElements redefinition issues).

Implemented (Storybook)
- Updated app stories to use `hash-router` and mock DataService that dispatches `data-loaded`.
- Normalized mock routes with `id` and `sortDate` to match app expectations.
- Pages: By Date (next 7), By Worker (emoji picker), and AppLayout routes.

Fixes
- route-list now groups correctly when filtering on array fields (e.g., workers) to avoid duplicates.
- Controllers attach `data-loaded` listeners before initial load; lists do not render prematurely.
- Router loads the current hash immediately after route registration to avoid “Route not found” on first load.

How to run
- App (HMR): `npm install`, then `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173 (Disable cache in DevTools for reliability.)
- Storybook (HMR): `npm run storybook` → http://localhost:6008
- OAuth: Add http://localhost:5173 (and optionally http://localhost:6008) to Google OAuth “Authorized JavaScript origins”.

Key files
- Routing shell: `index.html`, `src/components/app-layout.js`, `src/components/hash-router.js`
- Controllers: `src/controllers/page-controller.js`
- Pages: `src/pages/boxes-page.js`, `src/pages/dates-page.js`, `src/pages/workers-page.js`, `src/pages/route-details-page.js`
- Components: `src/components/route-card.js`, `src/components/route-list.js`, `src/components/route-details.js`, `src/components/worker-component.js`, `src/components/inventory-component.js`
- Data: `src/services/data-service.js`, `js/sheets.js`

Outstanding / Next
- Add loading/empty states to `/dates` and `/workers` pages.
- Route Details parity polish (labels/order exactly like main; optional print section for market).
- Centralize text normalization utils and icon map in DataService; remove inline emoji maps.
- Ensure bottom tab highlight always reflects current route.
- Cleanup remaining legacy debug overlay / unused tab code paths.
- Optional: Deep-link filters (e.g., `/workers?worker=Name`), group volunteer-filtered results by volunteer.

Notes
- If edits don’t appear in dev: ensure DevTools “Disable cache” is on; the HMR hook triggers full reload on component changes. Hard reload (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R) clears stubborn caches.
